### Greatings, I am Dimitris, a highly motivated Full Stack and Game Developer. I am always motivated to learn new technologies and sharpen my skills!

## I currently work as a backend software developer at AnyDesk.
I have also worked at:
- **INVRTUAL GmbH**
- **CWA**

## Get to know me!
- :muscle: I have my [portfolio site], that displays all of my (personal, publicly available) work. Feel free to take a look around! You might find something you like!
- :computer: I currently work with ReactJS for frontend apps, NestJS for backend apps and Unity for games / VR modules!
- :page_facing_up: My main languages are Typescript and Rust for work and C# for Game Development, but I learn to work with low level languages, such as Go and C++!
- :rainbow: My dream is to make my very own game engine with Rust one day!
- :eyeglasses: I have worked on native iOs and Android projects, as well as with hybrid apps with Angular and Ionic, Capacitor and Cordova! I also have Flutter and Dart projects.
- :notes: I love writing songs and playing the bass guitar!
- :joystick: I am a huge gaming fan, currently playing VR and story-focused games mainly!
- :sparkles: At the end of January 2021, we launched a full-stack solution for a friend's online magazine, using Laravel and VueJS-NuxtJS. You can check it out here: [Banal Magazine][banal]
